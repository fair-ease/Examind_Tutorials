    "# Expose NDVI calculation as a CWL Dockerized process through Examind\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial / example is to demonstrate how to expose a dockerized process calculating NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) from satellite images using CWL in Examind Community. The final objective is to be able to expose this encapsulated process as a WPS process in Examind (or OpenEO, Process API).\n",
